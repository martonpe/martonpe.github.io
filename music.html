                            I have been DJing and producing music under the Menishu moniker since 2014.

                            Music and the utopistic comunities that can form around it have always been a very important part of my life. The last 10 years that have meant DJing and organizing parties, but before that i studied jazz guitar at the Conservatory of Budapest among other musical projects.

                        <p>
                            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OMOHbp">OMOH</a> was a queer techno party i organized in Budapest that ran from 2016 till 2022. Some of the most meaningful memories of my life are related to the community that formed around the project and the artistic flourishing it brought about.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            OMOH was always more than just a party. Most editions included some form of installation-performance-happening, some very DIY, some very elaborate, as dictated by the whims of the financial realities of organizing underground queer events in a country run by homophobic alt-right maniacs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The most ellaborate such happening was the appearance of the imaginary interplanetary being Mama Vulva in 2019. She clandestinely announced her arrival in a DJ mix: "I've come to liberate you from the schackles of heterosexuality". In addition to installations that served as altars to her, we also organized a 3 day workshop together with volunteers from the community, where we coreographed a ritual to honor her, that was then enacted at the party.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The beauty of organizing in a strictly no-photo space: nothing was ever documented. Mama Vulva was never seen again, yet never forgotten.
